# Programming for Mathematics

Mathematics course taken with Professor Martin Weissman at UC Santa Cruz during the Winter Quarter of 2021. This repository will include Jupyter notebook assignments done in the Python Programming Language.  

# Course Description: 
* Introduction to programming in Python with applications to advanced mathematics. Students apply data structures and algorithms to topics such as numerical approximation, number theory, linear algebra, and combinatorics. 

# Brief Notebook Assignment Description:

* Notebook #0 - My First Python3 Notebook: A brief introduction to the GitHub + CoLab + Jupyter + Python ecosystem.
* Notebook #1 - Computing with Python: An introduction to using Python as a calculator and to implementing a loop structure. 
* Notebook #2 - Functions and Control Statements: Exploration of Python functions, control statements, and while loops with applications to the Euclidean algorithm and to the Collatz conjecture.
* Notebook #3 - Lists: Deep dive into the Python list type, which includes mutability, list methods, slicing, implementing & optimizing the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and some Python techniques for data analysis and visualization.
* Notebook #4 - Introduction to NumPy and Visualization: Introduction to computation with NumPy and to data visualization, using MatPlotLib (for standard types of graphs) and Pillow (for low-level graphics manipulation).
* Notebook #5 - Put it Together: Quarter wrap up by implementing techniques learned in the quarter into various challenge problems, which include Euler's Idoneal Number and Pascal's Triangle.
